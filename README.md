#### Description: Movie Recommendation engine

This movie recommendation website is an interactive website built using Flask, Python, and JavaScript, with data processing powered by Pandas and scikit-learn. The website's goal is to allow users to search for movies, receive recommendations, and explore curated lists. By combining backend data processing with a responsive frontend, the platform provides a seamless user experience.

Initially the movie engine was implemented in Jupyter Notebook to test the algorithm, then it was converted to a normal python file.

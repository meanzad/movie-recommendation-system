### Description: Movie Recommendation engine

This movie recommendation website is an interactive website built using Flask, Python, and JavaScript, with data processing powered by Pandas and scikit-learn. The website's goal is to allow users to search for movies, receive recommendations, and explore curated lists. By combining backend data processing with a responsive frontend, the platform provides a seamless user experience.

Initially the movie engine was implemented in Jupyter Notebook to test the algorithm, then it was converted to a normal python file. While implementing in jupyter notebook, working with widgets was the method chosen to make the notebook interactive.

##### The datasets used in this project are linked here:

https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-25m.zip - only movies.csv and ratings.csv are used from this dataset for the recommendation algorithm.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows - this dataset was used for the top 1000 movies list and the suggest feature.

only the tep 1000 dataset has links for posters, this is why posters are absent in the recommendation feature.
